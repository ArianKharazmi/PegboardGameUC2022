Simple Pegboard Game for Computer Programming II



This is a simple Pegboard Game created for Computer Programming II. The main function of this board/program is to 'zero' out numbers on the board. 
You have ten attempts to 'zero' out the board, and you must use the numbers given within the contents of the board.
Numbers that have been used already or are 'outside' of the board will be refused, but will count as one attempt.

Feel free to give it a try!
